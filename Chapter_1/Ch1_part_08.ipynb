    "Measurement dimension is increasing rapidly (higher dimensional data); but the whole point of SVD is that, irrespective of this data size, there's still a low number of modes that actually matter (the information we care about is intrinsically low rank). This is what motivated the development of randomised linear algebra methods.\n",
