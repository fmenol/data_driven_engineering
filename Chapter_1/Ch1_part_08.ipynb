    "## Randomised SVD\n",
    "Measurement dimension is increasing rapidly (higher dimensional data); but the whole point of SVD is that, irrespective of this data size, there's still a low number of modes that actually matter (the information we care about is intrinsically low rank). This is what motivated the development of randomised linear algebra methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_INTUITION_** We can randomly sample the column space of a data matrix $X$ and hope to, just because of randomness, reconstruct the subspace spun by the columns of the actual $U$\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the matrix we are interested in is, indeed, low rank. Then we can undetake the following steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute a random projection $P \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times r}$ that we multiply on the column of $X$. Where $r$ is the target rank (this is the *real* rank of the system). Then we will multiply $X$ to the left of $P$: $Z = XP$. This will shrink the number of columns of $X$ from $m$ to $r$. Then we will calculate the QR factorization of $Z$ and $Q$ will then give us an orthonormal basis for $Z$ (and then for $X$ too since $Z$ shares the same column space of $X$). The intuition here is that, is $P$ is random, it will sample a random combination of columns in $X$ through $XP$ and this is why $Z = XP$ can share the same columnspace with $X$, it's just a byproduct of random sampling."
