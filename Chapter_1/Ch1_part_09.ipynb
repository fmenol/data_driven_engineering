    "This section deals with a simple concept: to decompose a 2D matrix, so far, we have _vectorised_ it, i.e. we made a long thing vector of a rectangular matrix. What if we did not need to? Because we actually didn't. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tensor decomposition extends matrix decomposition to N-dimensional arrays, i.e. tensors. The principle is simple: if SVD decomposes a matrix $X$ into:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "X = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\sigma_j * U_j \\circ V_j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. a sum of rank-1 matrices where $U_j$ and $V_j$ are a column and row vector respsectively, then we can certainly extend this to the 3 dimensional case, just by adding a outer product to a new vector (that captures the third dimension mode, e.g. time, if x and y are space)\n",
